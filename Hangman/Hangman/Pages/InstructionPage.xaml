            <Label Text=" Try guessing the vowels - A good strategy is to begin by guessing a few vowels. With only five vowels in the English alphabet, you'll quickly fill up those blanks without losing. It's just a list of the most common letters used in English, in order of frequency. 'E' is the most commonly used letter, 'T' is second-most common, etc. So try guessing those letters first. Don't forget your Js and Zs - The letters J and Z always trip people up. They're both fairly rare and it's not always obvious when you need one to complete a word or phrase. Don't guess a Z or a J at the very beginning, but keep them in mind as you play."
